# ForgeFX Programming Challenge

## Player Movement
As per the specs, the moving the viewpoint uses only the keyboard. The WASD or
arrow keys move the player forward/backward/left/right. If the \<SHIFT>
key is being held down, the WA keys and up/down arrow keys will tilt the
camera, and the AS and right/left arrows will pan the camera.

The \<HOME> and <7> key on the numeric keypad will rotate the camera to look at
the robot.

## Moving the Robot and Its Arms
Clicking with the left mouse button (LMB) and dragging either robot arm will
move the arm. If the LMB is released near the shoulder, the arm will reattach.

Similarly, clicking and dragging the robot torso will move any part attached
to the torso. That is, if an arm is detached, moving the rest of the robot will
not move that arm.
